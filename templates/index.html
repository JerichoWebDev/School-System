                CSU was first conceived in 1918 as the Agusan Agriculture High
                School (AAHS)thru the passage of an Omnibus Bill filed by the
                First Congresswoman of the Philippines, Honorable Elisa Rosales
                Ochoa. On February 14, 1920, Proclamation Number 4 was passed by
                the American Governor to the Philippines Francis Burton
                Harrison, declaring the reservation of a 232-hectare virgin
                forest land in Barrio Ampayon, in the Municipality of Butuan,
                province of Agusan del Norte as the grounds of the young school.
                However, it was only at the close of World War II in 1946 that
                the Agusan Agricultural High School (AAHS) was established in
                the reserved area.
